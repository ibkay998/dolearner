## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve Plan**: Confirm priorities and timeline
2. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with DSA challenge expansion (working solution first)
3. **Implement Streak Tracking**: Add calendar-based streak monitoring
4. **Enhance Admin Tools**: Improve DSA-specific admin interface
5. **Security Implementation**: Docker sandboxing and security measures (final phase)
6. **Iterate and Improve**: Regular testing and user feedback integration

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming DoLearner into a robust, feature-rich coding practice platform with expanded DSA capabilities and streak tracking, with security measures implemented as the final phase once we have a fully working solution.
