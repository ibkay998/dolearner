# Production Security Recommendations for DoLearner Platform

## Overview

This document outlines critical security measures that should be implemented before deploying the DoLearner platform to production. The current implementation uses Node.js's `vm` module for running user code, which is **not secure** for untrusted code execution.

## Current Security Concerns

1. **Inadequate Sandboxing**: 
   - The Node.js `vm` module is explicitly not designed for running untrusted code
   - The current sandbox can be escaped by malicious code
   - All code runs in the same Node.js process as your server

2. **No Container Isolation**: 
   - There is no physical isolation between the execution environment and your server
   - Malicious code could potentially access server resources

3. **Limited Input Validation**: 
   - Basic compilation validation exists but lacks comprehensive security checks

## Required Security Measures for Production

### 1. Implement True Isolation

- **Docker Containers**:
  - Run each code submission in a separate Docker container
  - Set strict resource limits (CPU, memory, network, disk)
  - Use read-only file systems where possible
  - Implement timeouts to prevent infinite loops

- **Serverless Functions**:
  - Consider AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for isolation
  - Each submission runs in a completely separate environment
  - Built-in resource limitations and timeouts

### 2. Enhance Input Validation

- **Static Analysis**:
  - Implement code scanning to detect potentially malicious patterns
  - Check for attempts to access system resources
  - Look for known exploit patterns

- **Resource Limits**:
  - Set strict limits on code size
  - Limit execution time
  - Restrict memory usage

### 3. Improve the Testing Framework

- **Proper Testing Environment**:
  - Use Jest or another testing framework in the isolated environment
  - Set up a more robust way to run React tests
  - Ensure tests can't be manipulated to execute malicious code

### 4. Implement Rate Limiting

- **API Protection**:
  - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of your testing API
  - Limit submissions per user/IP address
  - Implement graduated response to potential attacks

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Docker-based Solution

```javascript
// Example architecture for Docker-based solution
async function testUserCode(code, challengeId) {
  // Create a unique container ID
  const containerId = `test-${uuid()}`;
  
  // Write code to a temporary file
  await fs.writeFile(`/tmp/${containerId}.js`, code);
  
  // Run Docker container with strict limits
  const { stdout, stderr } = await exec(`
    docker run --rm \
      --name ${containerId} \
      --memory=128m \
      --cpus=0.5 \
      --network=none \
      --read-only \
      --volume /tmp/${containerId}.js:/code.js:ro \
      --workdir /app \
      code-testing-image \
      node /app/run-tests.js /code.js ${challengeId}
  `);
  
  // Parse and return results
  return JSON.parse(stdout);
}
```

### Option 2: Serverless Functions

- Deploy test runners as serverless functions
- Each submission triggers a new function instance
- Results are returned via callback or storage

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Implement container-based or serverless isolation
- [ ] Set up resource limits and timeouts
- [ ] Add static code analysis for security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Create monitoring for suspicious activities
- [ ] Develop an incident response plan
- [ ] Regular security audits of the testing system

**IMPORTANT**: Do not deploy to production without implementing these security measures. The current implementation is suitable for development but not for handling untrusted user code in production.
